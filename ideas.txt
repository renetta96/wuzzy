ideas

summoner style :
(2p) either
- Tyrant I: buff charater, nerf minions, affect other skills
- Tyrant II: on receive any damage, has % to deal 10x that damage to a nearby minion. Higher % at lower health, reaching 100% at 30% hp
or
- Shepherd I: buff minions, nerf character, affect other skills
- Shepherd II: enrage X minions on attacked, stronger buff when low health

(2p)
- summon rotation: instead of round robin, fix the same type every 20s
- swarm: deal more damage as more same type around, compared to others => rewarding building fewer variants, or the above

Metapis (only unlock at most 3)

(8p)
- mutant: 
	. I
	. II -> add crit poison to Wuzzy as well
- shadow: 
	. I
	. II => when a metapis died in Frenzy, => much higher chance to spawn more shadowlings
- moonguard:
	. I
	. II
- voltwing
	. I => move "charge" ability here,
	. II => Wuzzy's attacks may charge X random rangers nearby. Applied a debuff, when target unfreeze => explode many wisps around
- mimic
	. I ??: if no other types around => what to copy? maybe do nothing => weaker 
	. II ??: swarm - deal more damage as more mimics around, any other minion die => % to spawn a lesser mimic
	. can rotate mimics based on built hives, not nearby.
	. can keep many powers as once.
- alchemist
	. I ??
	. II ??
	. pain killer / tolerance: delay damage, or direct damage -> overtime damage, combo with tyrant sacrifiie
	. frenzy: very low attack cooldown, no running away, shorter animation
	. level2: frenzied minions on death would explode, causing massive damage.
	. honey puddle: aoe slow + more damage taken by bees / aoe heal
