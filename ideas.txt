ideas

summoner style :
(2p) either
- Tyrant I: buff charater, nerf minions, affect other skills
- Tyrant II: on receive any damage, has % to deal 10x that damage to a nearby minion. Higher % at lower health, reaching 100% at 30% hp
or
- Shepherd I: buff minions, nerf character, affect other skills
- Shepherd II: enrage X minions on attacked, stronger buff when low health

(2p)
- summon rotation: instead of round robin, fix the same type every 20s
- swarm: deal more damage as more same type around, compared to others => rewarding building fewer variants, or the above
